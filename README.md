# Web-scraping-and-more
A project where web scraping, APIs, and transferring data from Python to SQL is done! 🐍 🐬

# Project Description 
🐍 In this project I used web scraping through BeautifulSoup in Python. I cleaned the data and sent it to MySQL 🐬 for future analysis.

This project was developed with different approaches in order to get the information (data) from different sites. 
As web scraping (with Python) was used, :fire: also APIs were needed when creating other tables.
At this point, the project won't be showing the part of data analysis, but the extraction, transformation ✨, and storage of the data gathered.✨

# How is it looking?
It's looking good! 😝

The table for cities🍬 was created by web scraping Wikipidia🔓. My list of cities🍬 is [Hamburg, Munich, San Francisco, and La Paz].
The table should have the cities' name, thier latitude and longitude. With this info the table for weather will be populated!

Also there is a table for population connected to cities🍬 by the city_id.

For the table of weather; I took the API from OpenWeather and chose the "5 day weather forast". The nice thing about the weather table is that not only shows the forcast by the day, but also be a range of hours.🎉 

The last three tables were gathered with an API from RapidAPI and AeroDataBox. The data showing is about airports and flights ✈️

I must say, we lost the airport for the city of La Paz as the information gathered was "different" from the rest. 🌎
But the tables show cool information which is linked or connected to our main table cities🍬

Go ahead now and have a look! 👀     😃
